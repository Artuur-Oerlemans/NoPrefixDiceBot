# NoPrefixDiceBot
Dice bot without the usual limitations:
<ol>
  <li>Does not need a prefix for commands</li>
  <li>Number of dice in roll and number of sides is only limitted by the discord character limit</li>
  <li>Avoids floating point rounding which occurs in the default random number generator in python</li>
</ol>
